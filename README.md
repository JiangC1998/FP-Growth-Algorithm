# FP-Growth-Algorithm
A python implementation of FP growth algorithm for frequent pattern mining.

The implementation correctness has been verified with the [Apriori algorithm in mlxtend](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/frequent_patterns/apriori/).

### Features:
- Support mining the patterns in parallel
- Unit test, including compare found patterns with Apriori algorithm on generated dataset
